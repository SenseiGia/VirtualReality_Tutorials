# Virtual Reality Tutorials (In The Works)
These tutorials are designed as set of many tutorials which will build up your ability and confidence to create a Virtual Reality Application.

## Resources Needed:
The following Tutorials were designed and tested with the following:

### Hardware
1. Android Phone or Device with Android 4.4 'KitKat' (API level 19 or higher)
2. Google Cardboard (Both Version 1 and 2 work)
3. Proper cable to connect Phone to computer

### Software
1. Android Studio (Version 2.3.3 or higher)
2. Android SDK 7.1.1 'Nougat' (API level 25 or higher)
3. Latest Google VR SDK for Android

**Note: Other hardware may be used in place but at time of creation of documentation, I do not know.**

## Install Everything needed on you System

### Android Studio
Start off by Getting the latest version of [Android Studio (v3.3.1)](https://developer.android.com/studio/) for Windows, macOS, or Ubuntu.

Follow the install instructions provided by [Android Studio Install Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and feel free to customize the settings to your preference as they may be adjusted in settings later. Once Android Studio has been installed, open Android Studio and finish the remaining configurations. You should see the window below appear.

### Android SDK
From the screen above, click the Configure button to bring out the list of options where you can then select SDK Manger. Before downloading any of the available Android SDKs, find the SDK used by your phone 

**On Phone: -> Settings -> About phone -> Android Version: #.#.#**

If the version is newer than Android SDK 7.1.1 'KitKat', the device is supported and you can proceed with downloading the SDK for Android Studio. Select the SDK by clicking on the checkbox and progress by clicking 'Apply' or 'OK', which will download the SDK to your system.

### Google VR SDK
Once Android Studio has been prepared with the proper SDK, the last bit of software needed is the the Google VR SDK, which can be downloaded from the GitHub releases page found here: https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-android-sdk/releases. Download the zip file and extract the folder in a convinient location.

## Prepare Android Device for Android Studio 
In order to have Android Studio to interface with the Andriod Device, you must first allow USB Debugging on the device. This can be done by first [enabling developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) and then [enabling USB Debugging](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#debugging). Once USB Debugging as been enabled, you should be able to connect you Android Device to you computer with Android Studio through the proper cable.
